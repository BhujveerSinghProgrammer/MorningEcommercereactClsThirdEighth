//Advices:-
1.dont use props drilling
2.use context in cases where your app is very minimaliztic or one or two extra rerender would not cause any problem.
3.setting a redux,adding a package,all of that is costly than using context,if you do very complex data management then use Redux.
else use context for minimal use state management applications.
