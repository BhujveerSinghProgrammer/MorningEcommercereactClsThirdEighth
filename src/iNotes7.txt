Jest and Cypress are popular JavaScript testing frameworks, but they serve different purposes in the testing ecosystem.

Jest

Purpose: Primarily used for testing JavaScript code, especially in React applications. It can also handle other types of tests like integration tests.


Features:---

Fast and Isolated: Each test runs in isolation, which helps identify issues quickly.

Built-in Mocks: Jest comes with built-in mocking capabilities, making it easier to test components in isolation.

Snapshots: It supports snapshot testing, which allows you to track changes in your components.
Easy Configuration: Requires minimal setup and configuration to get started.

Cypress:-


Type: End-to-end testing framework.

Purpose: Designed for testing web applications in a browser. It allows you to simulate user interactions and test the entire application flow.

Features:

Real-Time Testing: Provides an interactive test runner that shows tests as they run in real-time.

Automatic Waiting: Automatically waits for elements to appear, eliminating the need for manual timeouts.

Network Control: Allows you to stub network requests and control responses, making it easier to test different scenarios.

Debugging Tools: Offers powerful debugging capabilities through the browserâ€™s developer tools.
